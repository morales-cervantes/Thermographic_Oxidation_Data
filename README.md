# Thermographic_Oxidation_Data

## Description

This repository contains a comprehensive database of thermograms captured during oxidation experiments on 1045 steel using an OPTRIS PI infrared camera. The data includes thermal images of samples subjected to various temperature conditions, offering a valuable resource for analyzing oxide layer growth and thermal uniformity in metallic materials.

The thermographic images are provided in CSV format, with each file containing the temperature matrix corresponding to a single thermogram. This resource is aimed at researchers in materials science, metallurgy, and those interested in thermal imaging analysis applied to the characterization of oxidation processes.

## Data Contents

- **Thermograms**: CSV files representing the temperature matrices of the samples at different stages of oxidation.
- **Metadata**: Information about the conditions under which each thermogram was captured, including temperature settings, time stamps, and environmental conditions.

## Usage

Researchers can use this dataset to:

- Analyze the growth and distribution of oxide layers on metallic surfaces.
- Study the thermal uniformity and heat distribution in 1045 steel samples.
- Develop and test new algorithms for thermal imaging analysis in material science.

## Requirements

To work with the CSV files, you may need:

- Python (with libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)
- MATLAB or other tools capable of processing CSV files and performing matrix operations
